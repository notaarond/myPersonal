git init : start your first commit in current directory

git clone : allows you to add a remote repository via http url

git status : lists untracked files, modified files, removed files, renamed files, and more

git add : add files to staging area to be committed

git diff : allows you to view the changes made to files from last commit
add the key word '--staged' to see staged items vs last commit ('--cached' is also the same thing)

git commit : could use this to commit what's in your staged directory, but I recommend adding the keyword '-m (commit message)' to make things easier on yourself

git rm : removes a file so that it isn't tracked (the 'rm' command simply removes the file from the working directory)

git mv (file1) (file2): basically renames the files, but is really a move command

git log: allows you to see the commit history (has a ton of other options for output, but I'm not going to use it to that complexity anyways)

git commit --amend : takes current staging area and uses it to completely replace the previous commit, including message

git reset HEAD (filename) | unstage a file (can find this when you run git status)

git checkout -- (file) : revert a file PERMANENTLY back to what it was at last commit
(can also find this command with git status)

git remote : lists shortnames of all the remotes the user has handled
adding '-v' lists urls of the remotes

git push (remote) (your_branch) : push your local changes to the remote
